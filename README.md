Heya world

am @yumemiruu – part-time artist, part-time programmer, and full-time dreamer

About me:
    interests: i love all things art and drawing, and i occasionally dabble in the world of programming. My experience includes:
        C (shoutout to 42’s C Piscine)
        Python
        HTML (ok, ok, not technically a "programming language," but i still enjoy it)
    currently learning more about C programming every day (i try ok? ;w;)
    am constantly sleepy and wish i could nap while i code..
